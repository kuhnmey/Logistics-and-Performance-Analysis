# Logistics and Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes logistics operations to uncover the drivers of high transportation costs, frequent delivery delays, and inefficiencies across routes, vendors, and invoice types. The aim is to support cost reduction and performance improvement through data insights.

---

## Objectives
- Identify routes and vehicle types with the highest costs
- Detect vendors with the most delivery delays
- Analyze invoice categories to spot cost spikes
- Generate key performance indicators (KPIs) for decision-making

---

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning, PivotTables, charts
- **Power BI** *(optional)*: Interactive dashboards for deeper insight

---

##  KPIs Tracked
-  Total Supplier Cost  
-  Average Delivery Delay  
-  Most Expensive Route  
-  Most Delayed Vendor  

---

##  Key Insights
- Certain vendors consistently caused delays across multiple routes.
- A few long-distance or under-optimized routes were responsible for a large share of total logistics cost.
- Penalty and fuel invoice categories were significant contributors to rising expenses.
- Data inconsistencies required cleaning and restructuring to enable proper analysis.
